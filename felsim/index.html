        <h1>Numerical Simulations of Free-electron Laser</h1>
        <p align="center">Tong Zhang</p>

        <p>Suppose your working environment is Linux operating system,
        in order to master the numerical simulations of free-electron laser,
        it is suggested that to get familiar with the open source evironment
        as much as possible, especially for whom wanna build numerical code
        to do specific research.
        </p>

        <p>Below is roughly the learning routine to achieve such goal.
        </p>

        <h3>Toolkits that need to be mastered</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Linux operation basis</em>, try to work in the command line interface (CLI), not graphical user interface (GUI).</li>
            <li><em>Shell scripting</em>, try to master linux CLI commands/tools as many as possible, e.g. <tt>bash, awk, sed, grep, find</tt>, etc.</li>
            <li><em>Pick up another programming language</em>, to do data processing, e.g. <tt>Python, Octave</tt> etc. <tt>Octave</tt> is an open source option for <tt>MATLAB</tt> if you're used to the syntax of <tt>MATLAB</tt>.</li>
            <li><em>Run code</em>, use <tt>Genesis 1.3</tt> to solve FEL equations, <tt>Elegant</tt> to do beam tracking, etc.</li>
            <li><em>Think WHY and HOW</em></li>
        </ul>
